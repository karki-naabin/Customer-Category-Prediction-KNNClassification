# Customer-Category-Prediction-KNNClassification

Dataset contains telecommunication provider's customer details. It has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns,
categorizing the customers into four groups.

If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can customize
offers for individual prospective customers.

The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups,
as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service

Multiclass Classification problem, a classifier was built to predict the class of customers using K-Nearest Neighbors ML algorithm.
